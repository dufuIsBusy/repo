1、A variable's data type determines the values it may contain
2、float:This data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency. For that, you will need to use the java.math.BigDecimal class instead
3、boolean:This data type represents one bit of information, but its "size" isn't something that's precisely defined.
4、Enclosing your character string within double quotes will automatically create a new String object;
5、 Relying on such default values, however, is generally considered bad programming style
6、Local variables are slightly different; the compiler never assigns a default value to an uninitialized local variable
7、 A literal is the source code representation of a fixed value; literals are represented directly in your code without requiring computation
